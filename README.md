# Sole Night
An exciting solo rogue-like fighting game where you can explore unique rooms, be your own favourite hero, and epically fight villains with the help of rare pickupable weapons. You have one night to sneak in and lure out the final boss by defeating all of its pawns, finally retreiving the precious muffins they stole from you. Mission: save the world from an evil organization that picks on innocent civilians while avenging your lost muffin brothers. Beware, the mysterious being everyone calls "boss"; nobody has ever seen it and come out alive so be prepared for absolute destruction upon entering its quarters.
